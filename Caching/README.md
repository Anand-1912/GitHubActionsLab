### Understanding Cache Accessibility in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows workflows to use caches to speed up tasks like dependency installations. However, there are limitations on how caches can be shared across different branches and tags.

#### Key Points:
1. **Caches are specific to branches or tags**.
2. **A cache created on one branch/tag cannot be accessed by a workflow run on another branch/tag**.

### Examples with Visualizations

#### Example 1: Branches and Caches

- **Main Branch**: `main`
- **Feature Branches**: `feature-a`, `feature-b`, `feature-c`

##### Visualization:

```
main
 â”œâ”€â”€ feature-a
 â”œâ”€â”€ feature-b
 â””â”€â”€ feature-c
```

**Scenario 1: Cache on Child Branch**:
- **Cache Creation**: A cache is created in `feature-b`.
- **Access**: 
  - **Allowed**: `feature-b` can access this cache.
  - **Not Allowed**: `main`, `feature-a`, and `feature-c` cannot access this cache.

```
(feature-b)  ----> Cache created
(main)      ----> Cannot access the cache created by (feature-b)
(feature-a) ----> Cannot access the cache created by (feature-b)
(feature-c) ----> Cannot access the cache created by (feature-b)
```

**Scenario 2: Cache on Sibling Branches**:
- **Cache Creation**: A cache is created in `feature-a`.
- **Access**: 
  - **Allowed**: `feature-a` can access this cache.
  - **Not Allowed**: `main`, `feature-b`, and `feature-c` cannot access this cache.

```
(feature-a)  ----> Cache created
(main)       ----> Cannot access the cache created by (feature-a)
(feature-b)  ----> Cannot access the cache created by (feature-a)
(feature-c)  ----> Cannot access the cache created by (feature-a)
```

#### Example 2: Tags and Caches

- **Tags**: `release-a`, `release-b`
- **Base Branch**: `main`

##### Visualization:

```
main
 â”œâ”€â”€ tag: release-a
 â””â”€â”€ tag: release-b
```

**Scenario: Cache on Different Tags**:
- **Cache Creation**: A cache is created on the `release-a` tag.
- **Access**:
  - **Allowed**: `release-a` can access this cache.
  - **Not Allowed**: `main` and `release-b` cannot access this cache.

```
(release-a)  ----> Cache created
(main)       ----> Cannot access the cache created by (release-a)
(release-b)  ----> Cannot access the cache created by (release-a)
```

### Summary:

- **Child Branch Cache**: A cache created on a child branch is not accessible to the parent branch or any sibling branches.
- **Sibling Branch Cache**: A cache created on one sibling branch is not accessible to other sibling branches.
- **Tag Cache**: A cache created on one tag is not accessible to other tags, even if they share the same base branch.

These rules help ensure that caches are specific to the workflows that created them, avoiding unintended conflicts or misuse across different branches and tags.


-----------------------------------

### Key Concepts:
1. **Cache Isolation**: Caches are specific to branches or tags.
2. **Access Rules**:
   - Workflow runs can access caches created in the current branch or the default branch (usually `main`).
   - Workflow runs triggered by pull requests can access caches created in the base branch, including base branches of forked repositories.

### Visualization and Examples:

#### Scenario 1: Basic Branch Cache Access

- **Branches**: `main`, `feature-a`
  
**Current Branch (`feature-a`) and Default Branch (`main`)**:
- **Current Branch Cache**: A cache created in `feature-a` can be accessed by workflow runs in `feature-a`.
- **Default Branch Cache**: A cache created in `main` can be accessed by workflow runs in `feature-a`.

```
main         ----> Cache accessible
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature-a  ----> Cache created and accessible
```

**Visual Example**:
```
  Branch: main (default)
  |--> Cache created in 'main' (accessible)

  Branch: feature-a
  |--> Cache created in 'feature-a' (accessible)
  |--> Can access cache from 'main'
```

#### Scenario 2: Pull Request Cache Access

- **Branches**: `main`, `feature-a`, `feature-b`
- **Pull Request**: From `feature-b` to `feature-a`

**Cache Access in Pull Request from `feature-b` to `feature-a`**:
- **Current Branch Cache**: Caches created in `feature-b` can be accessed.
- **Base Branch Cache**: Caches created in `feature-a` can be accessed.
- **Default Branch Cache**: Caches created in `main` can be accessed.

```
main
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature-a
        â”œâ”€â”€ feature-b
```

**Visual Example**:
```
Pull Request: feature-b -> feature-a
  |--> Cache created in 'feature-b' (accessible)
  |--> Can access cache from 'feature-a' (base branch)
  |--> Can access cache from 'main' (default branch)
```

#### Example Summary with Visuals:

##### Example 1: Cache Isolation

**Branch Hierarchy**:
```
main (default)
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature-a
  â””â”€â”€ feature-b
```

**Cache Access Rules**:
- **Current Branch (feature-a)**: Can access caches created in `main` and `feature-a`.
- **Current Branch (feature-b)**: Can access caches created in `main` and `feature-b`.

```
feature-a:
  - Accesses: caches in 'main' + 'feature-a'
  
feature-b:
  - Accesses: caches in 'main' + 'feature-b'
```

##### Example 2: Pull Request Cache Access

**Branch Hierarchy**:
```
main (default)
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature-a (base branch)
        â””â”€â”€ feature-b (current branch for PR)
```

**Pull Request from `feature-b` to `feature-a`**:
- **Current Branch (feature-b)**: Can access caches created in `main`, `feature-a`, and `feature-b`.

```
Pull Request: feature-b -> feature-a
  - Accesses: caches in 'main' + 'feature-a' + 'feature-b'
```

### Summary

- **Basic Cache Access**:
  - **Current Branch**: Accesses caches from itself and the default branch (`main`).
- **Pull Request Cache Access**:
  - **Pull Request Branch**: Accesses caches from itself, the base branch, and the default branch (`main`).

These rules ensure that caches are used efficiently while maintaining isolation and security between different branches and tags.


Yes, `npm ci` can utilize the npm cache to improve the speed of installations, similar to how `npm install` works. However, its behavior regarding the cache has specific nuances:

### How `npm ci` Uses the Cache

1. **Clean Slate Installation**:
   - `npm ci` always deletes the `node_modules` directory before installing packages. This ensures a clean and consistent state for the dependencies.

2. **Fetching Packages**:
   - When `npm ci` installs the dependencies listed in `package-lock.json`, it will first check the local npm cache for these packages.
   - If the required packages are found in the cache, `npm ci` will use them instead of downloading them again, which can significantly speed up the installation process.

3. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - The npm cache is stored in a local directory on your machine (e.g., `~/.npm` on Unix-based systems or `%APPDATA%/npm-cache` on Windows).
   - `npm ci` uses this cache to avoid redundant network requests and to speed up installations by reusing previously downloaded packages.

### Summary

- **Yes, `npm ci` uses the npm cache** to fetch dependencies if they are already available locally.
- **Key Benefits**: This makes `npm ci` installations faster and more efficient by leveraging cached packages, while still ensuring a clean and consistent `node_modules` directory by removing it before installing packages.

### Example Workflow

1. **First Run**:
   - `npm ci` installs all packages by fetching them from the npm registry (and caches them locally).

2. **Subsequent Runs**:
   - `npm ci` checks the local npm cache for the required packages.
   - If found, it uses the cached versions, making the installation process faster.

### Visual Example

#### Initial State
```
~/.npm-cache/
  |-- lodash-4.17.21.tgz
  |-- react-17.0.2.tgz
  |-- ...
```

#### Command: `npm ci`

1. **Before**: `node_modules` directory is deleted.
2. **During**: `npm ci` looks for packages in `~/.npm-cache`.
   - Finds `lodash-4.17.21.tgz` and `react-17.0.2.tgz` in cache.
   - Installs them without re-downloading.

3. **After**: `node_modules` directory is rebuilt using cached packages.

```
Project Directory/
  |-- node_modules/
  |   |-- lodash/
  |   |-- react/
  |-- package.json
  |-- package-lock.json
```

By utilizing the npm cache, `npm ci` ensures that even with a fresh `node_modules` directory, the installation process can be swift and efficient.
