## Notes

1. The Variables and Secrets can be created at the following levels.

   - Organization
   - Repository
   - Environments (defined in the Repository - Like Development, Staging and Production)

2. The Environment Variables defined using **env** are configured as ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES in the runner.

3. We can limit which branch or tag can deploy to a given environment by using protection rules. (Refer _ConfiguringEnvironments_ PDF)
