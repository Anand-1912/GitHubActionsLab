# When a concurrent job or workflow is queued,
# if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress,
# the queued job or workflow will be pending.
# Any pending job or workflow in the concurrency group will be canceled.
# This means that there can be at most one running and one pending job in a concurrency group at any time.
