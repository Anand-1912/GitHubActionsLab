1) So, At first , Github has webhooks for certain events
2) The Github actions system registers for these webhooks and provides its hook url
3) For eg, when I push a commit from local repo to github, I believe under the hood, an api call will be made to push the commit. 
The api request handler after doing its functionality( storing the commit in remote repo), it will identify the webhook subscribers for this event. 
One such subscriber is Github actions system. the api then will dispatch the webhook with the event payload   
4) The Github actions system (Receiver in this webhook architecture) will identifies the workflow that needs to be triggered for this event and schedules them to run on runners.

Is my mental picture correct ? 
-----------------------------------

Yes, your mental picture is **absolutely correct**, and you have effectively broken down the process! Here's a recap and minor refinements to confirm your understanding:

---

### Breakdown of Your Steps:

1. **GitHub Defines Webhook Events:**
   - GitHub has a predefined set of events (like `push`, `pull_request`, `issue_comment`, etc.).
   - These events are used to notify systems (subscribers) about changes or activities in a repository.

2. **GitHub Actions System Registers for Webhooks:**
   - GitHub Actions (as a system) internally registers itself as a **webhook subscriber** for specific events on repositories where workflows are configured. It provides a **hook URL** that GitHub uses to send event data.

3. **Commit Push and Webhook Dispatch:**
   - When you push a commit from your local repository to GitHub, this action triggers a **push API call** to GitHub.
   - The API handler processes the push, updates the repository (e.g., storing the commit and updating references), and then identifies **webhook subscribers** for the `push` event.
   - One such subscriber is the **GitHub Actions system**. GitHub dispatches the `push` event's webhook (as an HTTP POST) to the GitHub Actions service, along with the event payload (metadata like commit SHA, branch, author, etc.).

4. **GitHub Actions System Processes the Webhook:**
   - The GitHub Actions system, acting as the **receiver** in the webhook architecture:
     - Reads the webhook payload to understand the event (`push` in this case).
     - Identifies all workflows in the repository that are configured to respond to this specific event (based on triggers defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml` files).
     - Schedules the workflows to run on appropriate **runners**.

5. **Execution on Runners:**
   - The workflows are assigned to **GitHub-hosted runners** (or **self-hosted runners**, if configured).
   - These runners execute the steps in the workflow sequentially or in parallel, depending on the configuration.

---

### Key Insights to Reinforce:
- The GitHub Actions system is built around **webhooks** as the mechanism for event-driven execution. It listens to GitHub events using its **hook URL**.
- The **event payload** plays a crucial role in determining which workflows are triggered and how they execute.
- Your description effectively captures the **lifecycle of an event** from GitHubâ€™s API to workflow execution on runners.

### Visual Representation of the Flow:
1. **Commit Push**: Local repo â†’ GitHub API â†’ Repository updated
2. **Webhook Dispatch**: GitHub â†’ GitHub Actions Hook URL â†’ Event Payload Sent
3. **Workflow Triggering**: GitHub Actions â†’ Workflow Resolution â†’ Identify Relevant Workflow(s)
4. **Execution**: Workflow Steps â†’ Runners â†’ Completion

---

### Summary:
Your understanding of the system is spot-on! You've correctly visualized the event-driven architecture that connects **GitHub webhooks** with **GitHub Actions** and their execution pipeline. It's a well-thought-out mental model! ðŸ˜Š
